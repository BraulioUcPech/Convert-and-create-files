# Convert-and-create-files

This is a readme file for the convert-and-create-files project on GitHub. This project is a Python library that allows you to create files of different formats and export them to various formats. You can also read the files and manipulate them as you wish.

The supported formats are:

- JSON
- XML
- Word
- Excel
- SQLite
- Plain text

To use this library, you need to install it using pip:

`pip install convert-and-create-files`

Then, you can import it in your Python script:

`import convert_and_create_files as ccf`

To create a file, you need to specify the format and the content. For example, to create a JSON file with some data, you can do:

`json_file = ccf.create_file("json", {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "hobbies": ["reading", "writing", "coding"]})`

To export a file to another format, you need to specify the source file and the target format. For example, to export the JSON file to XML, you can do:

`xml_file = ccf.export_file(json_file, "xml")`

To read a file, you need to specify the format and the file name. For example, to read the XML file, you can do:

`xml_data = ccf.read_file("xml", xml_file)`

You can also manipulate the data in the file using the built-in methods of the library. For example, to add a new attribute to the XML data, you can do:

`xml_data.add_attribute("gender", "female")`

You can find more examples and documentation on the GitHub page of the project: https://github.com/convert-and-create-files

This project is open source and welcomes contributions from anyone who is interested. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to contact me at convert-and-create-files@gmail.com

Thank you for using convert-and-create-files!

This is a readme file for the convert-and-create-files project on GitHub. This project is a Python library that allows you to create files of different formats and export them to various formats. You can also read the files and manipulate them as you wish.

The supported formats are:

- JSON: A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines. JSON files have a .json extension and use curly braces to store objects and arrays.
- XML: A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML files have a .xml extension and use tags to structure the data.
- Word: A word processing format that is widely used for creating and editing documents. Word files have a .doc or .docx extension and can contain text, images, tables, charts, and other elements.
- Excel: A spreadsheet format that is widely used for storing and analyzing data. Excel files have a .xls or .xlsx extension and can contain worksheets, cells, formulas, charts, and other elements.
- SQLite: A relational database format that is self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration. SQLite files have a .db or .sqlite extension and can store tables, records, queries, and other elements.
- Plain text: A simple format that contains only text without any formatting or structure. Plain text files have a .txt extension and can be opened by any text editor.

To use this library, you need to install it using pip:

`pip install convert-and-create-files`

Then, you can import it in your Python script:

`import convert_and_create_files as ccf`

To create a file, you need to specify the format and the content. For example, to create a JSON file with some data, you can do:

`json_file = ccf.create_file("json", {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "hobbies": ["reading", "writing", "coding"]})`

This will create a file named json_file.json in your current directory with the following content:

To export a file to another format, you need to specify the source file and the target format. For example, to export the JSON file to XML, you can do:

`xml_file = ccf.export_file(json_file, "xml")`

This will create a file named xml_file.xml in your current directory with the following content:
