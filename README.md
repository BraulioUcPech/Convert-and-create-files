# Convert-and-create-files

This is a readme file for the convert-and-create-files project on GitHub. This project is a Python library that allows you to create files of different formats and export them to various formats. You can also read the files and manipulate them as you wish.

The supported formats are:

- JSON
- XML
- Word
- Excel
- SQLite
- Plain text

To use this library, you need to install it using pip:

`pip install convert-and-create-files`

Then, you can import it in your Python script:

`import convert_and_create_files as ccf`

To create a file, you need to specify the format and the content. For example, to create a JSON file with some data, you can do:

`json_file = ccf.create_file("json", {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "hobbies": ["reading", "writing", "coding"]})`

To export a file to another format, you need to specify the source file and the target format. For example, to export the JSON file to XML, you can do:

`xml_file = ccf.export_file(json_file, "xml")`

To read a file, you need to specify the format and the file name. For example, to read the XML file, you can do:

`xml_data = ccf.read_file("xml", xml_file)`

You can also manipulate the data in the file using the built-in methods of the library. For example, to add a new attribute to the XML data, you can do:

`xml_data.add_attribute("gender", "female")`

You can find more examples and documentation on the GitHub page of the project: https://github.com/convert-and-create-files
